abstract = {Gesture-based interfaces to control systems using full body or upper torso motions are becoming more common, particularly in the entertainment industry but increasingly in other domains. These interfaces may represent significant hurdles for individuals with motion or balance impairments. Even for non-impaired users, commands which are not readily represented by body mimicry require users to learn new non-intuitive gestures for adding layers of complexity in commands. In this paper, a reflection and clarification of these challenges is presented, based on some sample usage cases. Then a possibly solution path is presented, resorting to an idea originating in a science fiction novel, the shamanic interface imagined by Daniel Suarez. A reflection on its feasibility and on possible paths towards its creation is presented, as well as the possible impacts to render gesture-based interfaces more accessible to all and potentially easier to learn due to enhanced cultural awareness. The basic idea presented in this reflection paper is that the creation of a concern-separation layer between the gestures being executed by the users and their interpretation by computing systems can contribute both to the access by users with special needs and to all users in general, by enabling customized approaches to gesture-based control. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.
